# Amazon-Clone-
 This project is a clone of Amazonâ€™s homepage, developed using HTML and CSS to replicate its layout and design. The goal was to enhance my front-end development skills by working on a real-world UI/UX structure. This project focuses on visual presentation and responsiveness without JavaScript functionality.
